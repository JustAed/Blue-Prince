- First time:
	- A boy standing on a shore of white sand, looking for something he was told he can’t find
	- Black cat tied to a red flag (Red flag that does not wave in the wind)
	- A door with a moon, always locked with no key (It is what we are searching for)
- Second time:
	- Foresaw the house in ruin
	- [[8 Red Letters]] on 8 pedestals written by 8 different people, we will only read 7 of them
	- Like the painting in the rooms 1 letter is missing
- Third time:
	- HORROR GAME WHYYY IS IT NOW A HORROR GAME
	- ![[Pasted image 20260118160649.png | 250]] (at the end) (in [[The Tomb]]??)
